Live demo: https://campfinder-9y26.onrender.com

CampFinder is a website where users can create and review campgrounds. In order to review or create a campground, you must have an account. This project was completed as my capstone project at Minnesota State College Spring 2023.

This project was created using

- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB
- Bootstrap
- Passport.js was used to handle authentication.

## Features

- Users can create, edit, and remove campgrounds
- Users can review campgrounds once, and edit or remove their review
- User profiles include more information on the user (full name, email, phone, join date), their campgrounds, and the option to edit their profile or delete their account
- Search campground by name or location
- Sort campgrounds by highest rating, most reviewed, lowest price, or highest price

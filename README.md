## ‚öñÔ∏è Methodology
-	[Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) as the CSS framework to keep the UI simple and quick to build.
-	[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) as the Node.js application framework since it's a lightweight framework, which is ideal for gaining an understanding of how to build the backend from scratch. Compared to a framework like [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/) or even [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), Express.js doesn't have many features out of the box.
-	[PassportJs](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport) for the authentication and authorization.
-	NoSQL database for the flexibility compared to a SQL database, [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) in particular because of its prevalence in the industry.
-	[Embedded Javascript Templates (EJS)](https://ejs.co/) as the front-end templating language for more DRY code compared to plain HTML and for dynamic user-experiences. This is a simple templating language, similar to [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) for Python. Both however fall short on front-end scalability, modularity, and performance compared to a framework like [React](https://reactjs.org/). Working with simple templating languges helps to remind me the benefits of working with a framework like React.
